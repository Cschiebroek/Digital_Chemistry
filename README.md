Installation
-------------

   ```bash
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate mtl
   ```

This project also currently requires Marc Lehner's dash charges. Currently (05.03.2024), the public Github version is not working properly so you need to ask him for access to his private one.

Once you cloned the dash-tree repo, just go there and do

   ```bash
    python setup.py install
   ```

The current environment should hopefully do the job.

If you want to use dash trees, their path should be added in "utils_data.py"
